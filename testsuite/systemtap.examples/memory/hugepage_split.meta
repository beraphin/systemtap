description: Because some portions of the kernel code only work with normal-sized pages the kernel may convert a huge page into a set of normal-sized pages using a split operation. This operation may be relatively expensive and noticeable to latency sensitive programs. You can identify if split operations are occurring with the systemtap hugepage_split.stp script.
