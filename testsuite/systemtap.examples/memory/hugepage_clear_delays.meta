description: When a huge page is initially used by a process it must be cleared of its original contents to avoid leaking information between processes.  On x86_64 machines the huge pages are 2MB in size, 512 times larger than a normal 4KB page.  Thus, clearing a huge page can delay program execution by a hundred or more microseconds and maybe noticeable to latency sensitive programs.  This script will tally the number of times that each process triggers a huge page clear, the total time in microseconds spent clearing the pages, and the average time in microseconds of the huge page clear.
