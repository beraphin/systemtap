# this tests access to parameters from prologue-end PC addresses which
# land inside the scope of an inline instance; the functionality is
# provided by searching the function's DIE rather than the by PC
# proximity. (PR 1244)

# changed to find __audit_getname or audit_getname without checking
# kernel version to support backports.
