# PR16730: We should only list probes that can be traced back to the
# user's spec, not any auxiliary probes in the tapsets.
#
# There happens to be a begin(-1001) initialization probe in socket.stp,
# but a `stap -l socket.send` shouldn't list that

# First sanity check that the begin(-1001) probe is still present:
if ! stap -p2 -e 'probe socket.send { next }' | grep -q ^begin; then
  exit 2
fi


# Now make sure that the begin probe isn't listed:
if stap -l socket.send | grep -q ^begin; then
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
