systemtap monitor mode manual testing guide

Requirements:

Systemtap must be compiled with json-c and ncurses development
libraries present for this feature to work.

Testing steps:

1. Fire up a basic script:
  # stap --monitor -ve 'global x = 0; probe timer.s(1) {println(x++)}'

  - Check that the top window displays the module status and the bottom
    window contains the module output. Make sure that the status window
    displays the following information: uptime, uid, memory, module name,
    the global variable x and its current value, and the current list of
    probes.

  - Manually resize the terminal to check that each of the ncurses windows
    are also resized to take up 50% of the height of the terminal.

  - Test all of the commands listed in the help page by pressing h:
    - Pressing r should reset the global variable x to 0, the module
      output should change too.

    - Pressing s repeatedly should change the sorting attribute and
      reorder the probe list accordingly.

    - Pressing t will bring up the prompt to enter a probe index to
      toggle. Enter the index for the timer probe we have created
      and the probe's state should change to "off"; the module output
      should also stop. Toggle to probe again to reactivate it.

    - Pressing the u/d/pageup/pagedown keys should scroll the module
      output.

    - Pressing the j/k/down/up keys should scroll the probe list.

    - Press q to quit the script and make sure nothing crashes.

2. Fire up a script with high activity:
  # stap --monitor -ve 'probe vfs.read {println(1)}'

  - Make sure nothing crashes and exit the script.
