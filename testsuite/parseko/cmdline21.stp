# You have to specify ouput FILE with '-S' option
#
#-S size[,N]     Switches output file to next file when the size
#                of file reaches the specified size. The value
#                should be an integer greater than 1 which is
#                assumed to be the maximum file size in MB.
#                When the number of output files reaches N, it
#                switches to the first output file. You can omit
#                the second argument.
#-o FILE         Send output to FILE. This supports strftime(3)
#                formats for FILE.
