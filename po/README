Systemtap Internationalization:

The internationalization data will not be generated by default unless systemtap
is configured with maintainer-mode.  However, one can manually regenerate all 
files, including the source-filename-list po/POTFILES.in by executing
'make update-po' from the top-level source directory.

In order to generate a specific language, run the command: 
'make -C po language.gmo' where 'language' is the language you would like to 
have generated.

Systemtap has a translation page located at 
http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/systemtap/ which is automatically updated
to host the most up-to-date pot files. 

To begin a new translation of systemtap, simply copy the systemtap.pot file
to a new language.po file, fill in:
- PO-Revision-Date
- Last-Translator
- Language-Team
- CHARSET
- Plural-Forms
- Strings to Translate

If you're unsure of the specific plural forms of the language, they can be
found in the gnu gettext online manual located at
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Plural-forms
Once all translatable strings have been completed, generate the necessary 
files by running 'make -C po language.gmo' where 'language' is the 
language you would like to generate from the po file.

If there are any ambiguities or clarifications needed from the source, the
comment code '//TRANSLATORS: ' one line above a gettext string will be passed
through to the systemtap.pot file for translators to view.  Feel free to ask 
for any further clarifications either on the systemtap mailing list or on
the freenode #systemtap channel.

In the most general case, adding a translatable string can be done by simply
wrapping the string with the _() macro, ie. _("string to translate here").
The macro _F() has been used for autosprintf, _N() for ngettext, and _NF()
for a combination of autosprintf and ngettext.  For more information on how to
use gnu gettext please consult the online manual at
