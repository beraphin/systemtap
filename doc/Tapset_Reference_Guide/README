The Publican Tapset Reference Guide is build from files generated
during the build of SystemTap when it is configured with
"--enable-refdocs".

Assuming that SystemTap was built in /home/wcohen/systemtap/build, the
file needed to generate the Publican Tapset Reference Guide would be
/home/wcohen/systemtap/build/doc/SystemTap_Tapset_Reference/tapsets.xml.

To generate the required DocBook XML file of the tapsets.xml file and build
the Publican Tapset Reference Guide from this directory:

export BUILD=/home/wcohen/systemtap/build
./publicanize.sh -i=$BUILD/doc/SystemTap_Tapset_Reference/tapsets.xml

This will copy and clean the XML source of SystemTap_Tapset_Reference
created by kernel-doc and place the resulting file in
./en-US/Tapset_Reference_Guide.xml. You can now build it in pdf, html,
etc using Publican.  To make the Publican pdf file:

make pdf-en-US

The resulting output file will be
./tmp/en-US/pdf/Tapset_Reference_Guide.pdf

The main source of the Language Reference Guide is in the build directory:

	$BUILD/doc/SystemTap_Tapset_Reference/tapsets.xml

This main source is generated by kernel-doc when you run 'make' in the
main git tree. The tapset documentation inside is collected from all 
tapset files defined in the following template file:

	../SystemTap_Tapset_Reference/tapsets.tmpl

The tapset file definitions appear in tapsets.tmpl as:

	!Itapset/context.stp
	!Itapset/context-symbols.stp
	etc

context.stp, context-symbols, and all the other tapset files are located in:

	../../tapset

All tapset documentation should be done inside their respective tapset files.
