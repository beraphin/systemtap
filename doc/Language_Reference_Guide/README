This is an automated source build of the Language Reference Guide, 
used to build it in Publican.

To build the source, run:

	bash publicanize-langref.sh

This will copy the LaTeX source of the Language Reference Guide and
convert it to DocBook XML. You can now build it in pdf, html, etc 
using Publican. 

The main source of the Language Reference Guide is in:
	../langref.tex 

As such, any revisions to this document should be applied to ../langref.tex, 
not to the source in this directory.

IMPORTANT: 
The publicanize-langref.sh script uses latexml to create the raw XML files
from langref.tex first before cleaning it up for Publican. You will need 
LaTeXML along with all its required perl modules to use publicanize-langref.sh.

For more information on building from source, downloading, and installing LaTeXML,
